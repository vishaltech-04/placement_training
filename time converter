On one fine Sunday, Sita and Radha decided to solve puzzles. Sita asked Radha to solve her puzzle. Sita gave the puzzle on time. She gave Radha the number of hours, number of minutes and number of seconds as input. With the given input, Radha should find out the total number of hours, the total number of minutes and the total number of seconds. Help Radha by writing a program for this. For example, the input given by Sita is 1, 70, 5. Now, 70 minutes is equal to 1 hour 10 minutes.
