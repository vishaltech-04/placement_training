Deepak wants to know how to find whether the year is leap year or not.could you please help him to find the year is leap year or not. - A century year is a year ending with 00. A century year is a leap year only if it is divisible by 400. - A leap year (except a century year) can be identified if it is exactly divisible by 4. - A century year should be divisible by 4 and 100 both. - A non-century year should be divisible only by 4.
